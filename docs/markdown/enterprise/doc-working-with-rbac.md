### Permission Priority {#permission-priority}

When a request is made, the RBAC service decides whether a given request should be allowed or denied. The evaluation logic follows these rules:

 - By default, all requests are denied (_Note: when you creating a new user on Mobingi ALM, by default, this user has no permissions_ )
 - An explicit allow overrides this default
 - Deny pattern always overrides allow pattern against same resources
 - An explicit deny overrides any allows

 The order in which the policies are evaluated has no effect on the outcome of the evaluation. All policies are evaluated, and the result is always that the request is either allowed or denied. 



### Apply Order {#apply-order}

 - Allow pattern always applies first
 - Deny pattern overrides allows
 - Additionally, when the action performing user belongs to a _Team_ and both its user role and team role are attached, the _Team_ role will overwrite the user role.
