Mobingi ALM provides several built-in functions that help you manage your Alm-template. These functions are named __ATL__, short for ___A__lm __T__emplate __L__anguage._

Use ATL functions in your templates to assign values to properties that are not available until runtime.

__Note:__

    You can use ATL functions only in specific parts of a template. Please refer to each functions' document for detailed explanation.
